    title: "I am nowhere",
    specs:
      "I am nowhere, I am now here. In 2018 the Stadtgalerie Saarbrücken offered a scholarship for young artists. Our artist collective UBT, consisting of Lucie Sahner, Thilo Seidel and myself, had the chance to spend half a year dealing with the extensive topic of intimacy. The title of the exhibition, which was based on our long, individual research phase, is »Tender Kissing that leads to some rough assfucking stuff«. I explored the theme of subject-object dichotomy. My question was, how can intimacy be achieved without becoming or being absorbed by others. Where is the border around my personal space and what happens when borders are crossed. I ordered a bottle filled with the bioluminescent algae species of dinoflagellates in California. Over 3 months I bred these unicellular organisms and I was able to increase the population twentyfold. It was a very intimate process, I spent a lot of time with the dinoflagellates, I learned all about the right animal husbandry, how to mix salt water, which minerals have to be added to the food ... I often lay on the floor of the small dark room with the bottles lined up and played techno to the unicellular organisms. As a reaction they glowed bluish. In the exhibition you can find these experiences and the results of my research in the form of a large cube. On the outside there are 2.5 meter high letters, which are attached to 3 sides of the cube. Depending on the viewpoint of the viewer, one reads »I am nowhere« or »I am now here«. Inside, the visitor of the exhibition finds a completely dark interior, only in the middle of the room one can guess the basin, which contains my cultivated algae population. Before entering the room, the visitor is told that he can stimulate the algae population with a mechanism, but that this triggers a stress reaction in the algae, which can even lead to the death of the flagellates. What does the visitor choose, accepting the cell damage for the beauty of the blue glow, or does (s)he withdraw?",
